# Budget application for mobile devices

This application is made for users to help them plan any kind of budgets. Application was made as a 
final school project and also as it would serve my personal needs by keeping track of planned costs vs real costs. For users it's possible to:

- Add a budget
- Add new rows to budget
- Apply class for budget rows
- Add new classes
- Modify & delete budgets or budget rows

Application calculates budget rows and visualizes by colors if planned budget row is surplus or shortfall. 

## Techniques

Application was developed as a React Native Expo project. MySQLite works as a database in user's mobile device. Redux is used to take care of the
global state management. Expo router is used to navigate between screens.

## Other

Application interface is only in Finnish. Application is not (and will not be) added to markets of Google or IOS.
